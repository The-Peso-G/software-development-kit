## Clinical Meteor Conventions

They say the best way to win an argument is to avoid it.  Preferred language, best editor, testing framework choice...  so many opportunities for people to argue for their favorite technology.  So, before diving into Clinical Meteor, lets go over some conventions that are used.  These conventions are how I choose to write this cookbook, and allow me to write a coherent and cohesive resource for you to use.  If you disagree with any of them, please write your own Cookbook or release track.

====================================  
#### 1.  Pure Javascript (instead of CoffeeScript)
At the end of the day, the Cookbook is striving to build pure Javascript applications.  We understand the reasons why some people want to use CoffeeScript.  CoffeeScript does a lot of heavy lifting, standardizing things, can be cleaner to read.  But JavaScript is more performant; more precise; and is the language that the underlying interpreter is built in.  So, the Cookbook and it's examples and utilities are all written in Javascript.  

====================================  
#### 2.  Atom (JavaScript Editor)
Atom is written in Chrome/Javascript, and is therefore isomorphic to the rest of the framework.   The result being that a developer can hack on Atom, whereas they can't hack on Webstorm, Sublime, Emacs, Vim, etc.  That's enough to make Atom the preferred choice.

====================================  
#### 3.  Component/Microservice Architecture instead of MVC 

The terms Model, View, and Controller are used in so many different ways that the terms have become meaningless.  Every MVC library that we've run across (Backbone, Blaze, Ember, Angular, Famo.us, React, WebComponents, Semantic) are each reinventing the wheel, trying to get around the MVC model that the client-side HTML and CSS subsystems impose, and repurposing the terms Model, View, and Controller.  Suffice it to say that, after thinking on this issue for a year or two, the Cookbook is leaning towards an MVC-agnostic approach by using a component/microservice architecture (a mash-up of WebComponents, React, Blaze Components, and Famo.us).  If there's one rule about MVC, it's don't use MVC.  
 
 
====================================  
#### 4.  Starrynight instead of Velocity  
The Cookbook uses the StarryNight utility instead of Velocity for testing.  There are lots of reasons for this decision, but it basically boils down to the need to have something we can rely on and can contribute changes to when we need things changed.  

====================================  
#### 5.  Stability Over Latest Features
Clinical Meteor is all about getting Meteor through regulatory approval and used in situations where people's health and well-being may be impacted.  For that reason, we are interested in stability and reliability, and implement a [12 Factor App](http://12factor.net/) that passes the [Joel Test](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html).  That means we need quality control and quality improvement processes.  These processes necessitate that we go at a slower pace than the rest of the Meteor community and ecosystem.  Don't worry, we'll get all the fancy features in eventually.  But this isn't the place for experimental features.

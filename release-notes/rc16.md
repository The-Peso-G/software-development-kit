## RC16 - Epic 2015 Schemas  

Super excited to announce the largest Clinical Track release ever.  

RC16 Epic Schemas doubles the number of supported HL7 FHIR resource schemas to a total of 40 out of 100, and includes complete schema interoperability support for Epic 2015.  We've also removed nearly all Blaze dependencies; upgraded to Meteor 1.4.2, and have begun migration from Gagarin to the native Mocha integration.  The Clinical Meteor SDK now includes a range of full-stack Javascript utilities, including the Tensor Flow neural net, the Cornerstone DICOM viewer, and a SNOMED Express Rest API.  

Happy Holidays!

**Release Page**  
http://clinical.meteorapp.com/release/1.4.2-rc16

**Usage**  
Although not necessary to use the individual packages or FHIR resources, you can synchronize an app to the baselined dependency versions by running your app with the `--release` flag.

```bash
meteor --release clinical:METEOR@1.4.2-rc16
```

**Software Development Kit**   
Download the entire Clinical Meteor software development kit, including examples, utilities, design documents, and other resources.  
```bash
git clone --recursive http://github.com/clinical-meteor/clinical-meteor ClinicalMeteor
```

**Epic 2015 Interoperability**  
Clinical Meteor now supports 40 FHIR resources; including all 20 resources supported by Epic 2015.  See https://open.epic.com/Interface/FHIR for details on the Epic implementation of FHIR.  Resources in italics below are supported by Epic.

Meteor support for the HL7 FHIR spec can now be included in a project by adding the `clinical:hl7-fhir-resources` package.   
```sh
meteor add clinical:hl7-fhir-resources
```
For individual FHIR resources, use the `search` command or Atmosphere.
```sh
meteor search clinical:hl7-resource
meteor add clinical:hl7-resource-patient  // to add the Patient resource
````

**Pending On Roadmap**  
- Cerner FHIR Resources
- Meteor on FHIR Interface Engine  
- LOINC Web API  
- Open mHealth Schemas  
- Node/Python bindings
- BLAST Sequence Alignment Tools


**Validation/Verification Tests**  
273 validation tests on ChecklistManifesto  
135 validation tests on PersonalHealthRecord  
130 verification tests across 36 distro packages  
118 verification tests across 40 FHIR packages


Note:  We're streamlining and updating the quality control infrastructure; and will be re-baselining the distro on the Meteor on FHIR Interface Engine.  The validation/verification tests are currently in flux as we manage this refactor from Blaze to React.

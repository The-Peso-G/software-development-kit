## RC19 - MU2 Prerelease  

Happy Fourth of July!

Wow, it's been 9 months, and we have maybe the biggest update to Clinical Meteor yet.  Interoperability.  OAuth.  Continuity of Care Documents.  Patient Charts.  Blockchain.  Azure.  Security Audit.   

Since we last did a release (RC19, Aug 2017), we've managed to connect Meteor on FHIR to two separate hospitals, and pull medical charts from both.  In doing so, we had to fork the `oauth` packages from core Meteor.  It turns out that `oauth` and `accounts-oauth` were optimized for Facebook and Google and GitHub, and didn't support things like receiving a PatientId.  So we forked those packages, and implemented the SMART on FHIR specification (which relies on OAuth).   Along the way, we started working with a blockchain project that's implementing a distributed OAuth algorithm; and that got us involved in writing DApps for BigChain.  And that involved expanded support for FHIR Consent, Contract, Subscription, and Audit Event resources.   

In short, it's been a crazy busy 9 months.

**Usage**  
Although not necessary to use the individual packages or FHIR resources, you can synchronize an app to the baselined dependency versions by running your app with the --release flag.

```
meteor --release clinical:METEOR@1.6.0.1-rc20
```

**Software Development Kit**  
Download the entire Clinical Meteor Software Development Kit, including examples, utilities, design documents, and other resources.

```
git clone --recursive http://github.com/clinical-meteor/software-development-kit
cd clinical-meteor 
git submodule update --recursive --remote --merge
```

**Epic 2015 Interoperability**  
Clinical Meteor now supports 60 FHIR resources; including the ~16 or so packages commonly supported by Argonaut members (a consortium of EHR vendors). See https://open.epic.com/Interface/FHIR for details on the Epic implementation of FHIR.

**Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources**  
Meteor support for the HL7 FHIR spec can now be included in a project by adding the clinical:hl7-fhir-resources package.

```
meteor add clinical:hl7-fhir-resources
```

For individual FHIR resources, use the search command or Atmosphere.

```
meteor search clinical:hl7-resource
meteor add clinical:hl7-resource-patient  // to add the Patient resource
```

**SMART on FHIR**  
Clinical Meteor has forked the `oauth` and `accounts-oauth` package and made modifications to add SMART on FHIR support.  This primarily involves a `patientId` field that needs to be picked up and used; and adding support for OAuth scopes based on FHIR resource types.  Each application will have different needs around which scopes it needs to access and what it does with the patientId.  For those reasons, it's generally advisable to create a custom SMART on FHIR client package for each app you're trying to write.  We provide the `clinical:oauth` and `clinical:accounts-oauth` packages under an MIT license, and provide links to a sample `oauth-client` library which you can use to start your integration.  There is also a `symptomatic:smart-on-fhir-client` package available for license.  Contact sales@symptomatic.io for more details on licensing.


**Packages Confirmed to Work Together**  
Each release, we publish a list of packages that are known to work together.  As we migrate to NPM, we now have two supported package lists that we are keeping under QA.  Use these two files as a baseline for which packages to use.

**FHIR Conformance Statements - Touchstone Tests**
The Argonaut ProviderDirectory scripts required the FHIR Practitioner, Organization, Location, and Endpoint resources.  We simply implemented REST APIs to the spec.
